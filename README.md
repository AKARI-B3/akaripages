Start your very own open-ended Bitcoin Cash Peer-2-Peer (P2P) Micro-fundraiser today, for free, with zero fees.

Instructions (10-steps or less): <A href="http://agf.earth/guide/akaripages">View the visual guide here</a>

1. Download/clone the akaripages github repository.
2. Create your own github or bitbucket.io accounts (or upload to a webhost you own or manage).
3. Upload the akaripages files into your new repository, ex 'fundraiser'. Here is our example: http://akari-b3.github.io/fundraiser (or use FTP to upload to your own webhost).
4. Edit the text files with your desired settings. (Alternatively, edit before uploading).
5. In the donate folder, edit the .html to have your Bitcoin Cash (cashaddr) fund address instead. (Must Be CashAddr format minus "bitcoincash:" prefix http://agf.earth/guide/akaripages/images/cashaddress-892.jpg)
6. Make sure the front_donatelink.txt has been updated to match the donate page. (Alternatively, you don't need to use a donate folder, everything can go in the root folder).
7. Launch your new public campaign for free using github.io pages or bitbucket.io! (or your own website!)

Keep your page self-hosted or hosted on github.io pages. Do not post it on a website or service that you don't own or maintain access rights to. When you browse to your page, it will use the filename to prepare the payment page with included QR, copy-paste address, or mobile payment options. Having multiple ways to pay increases donations/payments significantly because it is much more convenient for the payee. Since it is self-hosted on your own servers or on github.io which includes version-control, that gives users more trust who are looking to pay or donate, increasing donations as well. 
If you're worried about it being modified via the FTP, setup an ftp monitor to alert you if files are changed.  You can easily keep track of your github.io/bitbucket.io files. If you are very worried, simply set up your own username account.

Enjoy your new payment / donate page and fundraising page!
